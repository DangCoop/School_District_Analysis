# School_District_Analysis

 **Education** has always been
important place in public life. The world is constantly faced with global problems, among which
abnormal warming, environmental pollution, constant population growth, lack of food resources, economic crises and so on. Many scientists and experts agree that these issues can be dealt with through education.
    Now we have a database with data for grades 9-12 for schools in one of the districts.
We set out to analyze this data in order to identify average data on grades, costs and passing grade, the number of students in schools and how this affects academic performance, which schools are more successful in relation to others, and what indicators lead to student achievement.


## __Our personal tasks is:__


+ Total number of students
+ Total number of schools
+ Total budget
+ Average math score
+ Average reading score
+ Percentage of students who passed math
+ Percentage of students who passed reading
+ Overall passing percentage
+ Total number of schools in the column "Total Schools"
+ Total number of students in the column "Total Students"

## ***___***My findings***___*** 

**You can argue for a long time and make many different conclusions, but still we will come to the same thing! The smaller the school, the more attention, and, accordingly, the better the performance of students! Well, in terms of costs, it also spends less at first glance. But the question becomes, how cost-effective is it for the state to maintain more schools with fewer students??? But this is a completely different analysis!**
